        I need to figure out how to implement this Math::ComputeExponent API. The
        input is a JSON object with two required properties: base and exponent, both
        numbers. The output should be just the result of raising the base to the exponent.\n\nFirst,
        I''ll think about how exponents work. For example, if the base is 2 and the
        exponent is 3, the result is 8 because 2^3 equals 8.\n\nI should consider
        different cases:\n1. Positive numbers: straightforward.\n2. Negative bases:
        need to ensure correct handling, especially with fractional exponents which
        might result in complex numbers, but since the output schema expects a number,
        perhaps we''ll handle only real results.\n3. Zero as base or exponent: zero
        raised to any positive exponent is 0; any number raised to 0 is 1.\n\nWait,
        but if the base is zero and exponent is negative, that would be undefined.
        So maybe the function should handle such cases by returning null or an error?
        But looking at the result schema, it''s just a number, so perhaps we''ll assume
        inputs are valid and let calculation proceed as per normal.\n\nNow, thinking
        about implementation in code. If I were to write this in Python, for example,
        it would be base ** exponent. That seems simple enough.\n\nBut wait, what
        if the numbers are very large? For instance, 2^1000 could result in a very
        big number or an overflow, but since the output is a number, it might handle
        it as a float or integer depending on the language.\n\nAlso, considering edge
        cases:\n- base = 0, exponent = 0: mathematically undefined. What should be
        returned? Maybe zero?\n- base negative and exponent fractional: results in
        complex numbers, which can''t be represented with a number type. So perhaps
        we''ll return NaN or some error value.\nBut the result schema expects just
        a number, so perhaps it''s assumed that such cases won''t be passed, or the
        function will handle them by returning an appropriate numerical value.\n\nIn
        any case, for the example given, base is 2 and exponent is 3. So I calculate
        2^3 = 8.\n\nI think the response should simply return the number 8 as a JSON
        object.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe result of raising 2 to the power of 3 is
        8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Input Analysis:** The input JSON
        contains \"base\": 2 and \"exponent\": 3.\n2. **Calculate Exponent:** Compute
        base^exponent, which is 2^3 = 8.\n3. **Return Result:** Output the result
        as a number.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n8\n```"},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":19797921359,"load_duration":6070309830,"prompt_eval_count":149,"prompt_eval_duration":29000000,"eval_count":563,"eval_duration":13261000000}'
