        I need to figure out how to compute 2 raised to the power of 3. Let me think
        about exponents for a moment. So, when you have an exponent like base^exponent,
        it means you multiply the base by itself as many times as the exponent indicates.\n\nIn
        this case, the base is 2 and the exponent is 3. That should be 2 multiplied
        by itself three times. Let me do that step by step:\n\nFirst multiplication:
        2 * 2 = 4.\nSecond multiplication: Take the result from the first step (which
        was 4) and multiply it by 2 again, so 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nSo after multiplying twice
        more, I end up with 8. Therefore, 2^3 equals 8. That makes sense because each
        time you''re doubling the previous result. So, yes, the answer should be 8.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe
        result of raising 2 to the power of 3 is calculated by multiplying 2 three
        times: 2 * 2 = 4 and then 4 * 2 = 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1.
        **Understand the Problem:** Compute base^exponent where base=2 and exponent=3.\n2.
        **Apply Exponentiation Rule:** Multiply the base by itself (base) exponent
        times.\n3. **Calculate Step-by-Step:**\n   - 2 * 2 = 4\n   - 4 * 2 = 8\n4.
        **Final Result:** The result is 8.\n\n**Answer:**  \n```json\n8\n```"},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":3547802924,"load_duration":34033221,"prompt_eval_count":148,"prompt_eval_duration":30442845,"eval_count":336,"eval_duration":3481477308}'
