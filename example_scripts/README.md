# Example scripts

There are various scripts in [./shorter](example_scripts/shorter) and [./higher_quality](example_scripts/higher_quality) that you can play with.

The difference between the two directories is that `higher_quality/` contains scripts that are more realistic
with more descriptions and comments and `shorter/` focuses on keeping the scripts short and simple.

Those directories also have a Gemfile each if helpful for pulling in dependencies
and so that you can use `bundle exec` there if needed.
